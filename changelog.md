## [1.0.4] - 2021-06-07

### Changed

- notifier: make sure performance_stats are always True

### Fixed

- remote_settings: don't overwrite hosts with None:- When `apm_host` or 
  `error_host` is undefined, it'll overwrite whatever value is in the 
  current remote config. We don't want that to happen.
- .pylintrc: disable 'consider-using-with':- This is just noise at the time 
  of writing this commit, but we should probably address it in the future.
- Pybrake query notifier throws error when query is a psycopg2 Composed
  object [#156](https://github.com/airbrake/pybrake/issues/156)
- Fixes exception for unhashable type: 'Composed' [#157](https://github.com/airbrake/pybrake/pull/157)

## [1.0.3] - 2021-04-13

### Fixed

- Flask Middleware :- Return response when performance_stats is false

## [1.0.2] - 2021-02-16

### Removed

- remote_settings: delete print that's left from debugging

## [1.0.1] - 2021-02-16

### Changed

- Change naming style for remote_settings, settings_data

### Fixed

- remote_settings: fix fetching config route (The config route setting has no 
effect due to a bug where pybrake doesn't read that value prior to making a 
GET request to the notifier config server. The fix is to call `config_route()`
on every notifier config GET call. Additionally, we are adding a logic that 
prevents remote settings to crash the background thread in case `config_route` 
is a bad value (HTTP lib would raise an error). When an error happens such as
403 Forbidden, we make a 2nd request to the old config route, which was known
to work)

## [1.0.0] - 2021-01-21

### Added

- Pybrake SDK
- Middleware for Flask, Django, celery, aiohttp frameworks
